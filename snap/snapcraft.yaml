summary: Asciiquarium is an aquarium/sea animation in ASCII art
description: |
  This program displays an aquarium/sea animation using ASCII art

  While running:

  * q:   quit
  * r:   redraw (will recreate all entities)
  * p:   toggle pause

  **Contributors**

  Pretty much all of the ASCII art was done by Joan Stark:

  Anything that she didn't do, I don't have a source for.
